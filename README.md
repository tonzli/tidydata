# Coursera Assignment - TidyData 

## General Description
The run_analysis.R script extracts Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, which can be downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones, and outputs a tidy dataset tidydata.txt. The output dataset contains the average of each variable listed below for each subject and activity. 

The script follows the following key steps:
1. Merge together the training set and test set
2. Extracts variables that correspond to the mean and standard deviation of each measurement
3. For each subject and each activity, calculates the mean of each variable
4. Writes the final result into a text file format data set
